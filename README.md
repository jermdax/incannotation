# IncAnotation
This project allows C code to be _annotated_ by using `#define`s
Minor code modification/generation will be performed so that the same source 
code can be used to generate seperate server and client code files.

The annotations are defined in a config file which also allows the user to
configure what action is to be taken on encountering an annotated declaration.

These annotations are limited to declarations.
